# Taming Thymeleaf with Kotlin + Gradle
My implementation of concepts taught in Wim Deblauwe's book [Taming Thymeleaf](https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/taming-thymeleaf-sources).

I use Kotlin and Gradle as opposed to Java and Maven.

I also use a different setup for Tailwind/NPM, see my demo and explanation here: [SpringBoot Live Reload w/Tailwind](https://github.com/djpeach/springboot-live-reload-tailwindcss)
